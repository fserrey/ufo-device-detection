# UFO device detection

_Our data science team has predicted that the Earth is going to be invaded by an alien force in the next years. Our only hope is to replicate a device that can block all alien technology in a radius of ~300km. Sadly, the device was sold in 2004 to an anonymous buyer to protect her hometown and we don't know how contact her again. We know that the device has been active since 2004 in one
city in the USA, and we want to know where to start our search._

This is the premise of the current assessment. We start the analysis in order to determine where this device could be.
